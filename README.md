# STREET GANG IRQ LOADER

This is my first reverse engineering effort. This is a cool little IRQ loader for the C64 that is from https://csdb.dk/release/?id=166304

I ripped the code for the IRQ loader back in 1989 and then it was used in a few demos I made like Animated Artistry in 1990. 

Since then it sat on some disks for a long long time. Back in 2019 I resurrected the code and used it as it was in PlasmaToy V2 simply linking the binary loader code into my demo. 

I really wanted to know more about how it works, so I have started documenting the reversing in a project. I am using the reversed loader in my latest WIP (tinn 64).
